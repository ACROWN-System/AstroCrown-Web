# AstroCrown Homepage Requirements — Development Baseline

## Purpose

Define the minimum auditable requirements for the AstroCrown homepage before substantive implementation begins.

This document defines requirements, not implementation. A requirement may be refined when new evidence appears, but implementation must not be used to silently invent missing requirements.

## Scope

Target: `index.html` / AstroCrown homepage.

Current implementation baseline: minimal HTML foundation in `development/index.html`.

Primary development environment: `development/`.

Regular/public website remains at the repository root and is not changed by this specification.

## Required Outcomes

### R-001 — Valid document foundation

The homepage must be a valid HTML document with:

- HTML5 document declaration.
- Explicit document language.
- Character encoding declaration.
- Responsive viewport declaration.
- Meaningful document title.

### R-002 — AstroCrown identity

The homepage must visibly establish AstroCrown identity.

The final identity treatment must use the approved AstroCrown visual identity and approved assets rather than recreating or inheriting the retired implementation.

### R-003 — Primary navigation

The homepage must provide clear access to the primary areas required by the current AstroCrown Web plan.

The navigation information architecture must be defined before implementation. Links must not be invented merely to fill a navigation bar.

### R-004 — Homepage content structure

The homepage must have a deliberate content hierarchy.

Each visible section must have an identified purpose and must contribute to the intended homepage outcome. Empty decorative sections or placeholder structures must not be added without a documented purpose.

### R-005 — Visual system

The homepage must use the approved AstroCrown palette:

| Name | HEX | Intended semantic use |
|---|---|---|
| AstroCrown Gold | `#FFD700` | Brand identity and primary emphasis |
| AstroCrown Black | `#050914` | Deepest background |
| AstroCrown Deep Space Blue | `#081426` | Main dark surfaces |
| AstroCrown Light Space Blue | `#16345A` | Borders, demarcation, separators |
| AstroCrown Green | `#20C878` | Positive financial state |
| AstroCrown Red | `#E5484D` | Negative financial state |
| AstroCrown Warning Yellow | `#FFD24A` | Warning, alert, caution |
| AstroCrown Warm White | `#FFF7E0` | Primary readable text |

Gold and Warning Yellow must remain semantically distinct.

### R-006 — Desktop-first implementation baseline

The first implementation target is the desktop/laptop web experience.

Responsive behavior must not be omitted from the design, but mobile-specific refinement is a later verification stage because mobile-device testing is currently unavailable.

### R-007 — Functional behavior

Every interactive element implemented on the homepage must have a defined purpose, expected behavior, destination or state change, and failure/edge condition where applicable.

No non-functional controls may be presented as functional UI.

### R-008 — Accessibility baseline

The homepage must use semantic HTML and accessible names/labels where applicable.

Keyboard access, focus visibility, text readability, image alternative text, heading hierarchy, and appropriate control semantics must be verified before completion.

### R-009 — Security baseline

The homepage must not introduce unnecessary executable code, dependencies, secrets, unsafe inline behavior, or untrusted content handling.

External dependencies must have an identified purpose and verification basis before inclusion.

### R-010 — Minimum-code principle

The implementation must use the smallest implementation that provides the required behavior and presentation.

Redundant CSS, JavaScript, listeners, dependencies, wrappers, compatibility mechanisms, or duplicate structures must not be added without an identified requirement.

### R-011 — Verification before promotion

The homepage must not be promoted from development into the regular/public website until its applicable requirements have corresponding verification evidence and unresolved blocking findings are addressed.

### R-012 — Desktop scroll model and scroll handoff

The desktop homepage must use a continuous page-scrolling model with controlled nested scrolling where a content area requires independent browsing.

For the market-directory interaction already explored and validated during development:

- The primary page/header remains fixed or otherwise continuously available while the page is scrolled.
- Sections that must remain associated with the viewport may use sticky positioning rather than becoming ordinary flowing content.
- The market directory is an independently scrollable content region when its contents exceed its defined desktop workspace.
- Scrolling inside the market directory must remain confined to that directory while it has scrollable content in the requested direction.
- When the directory reaches the relevant scroll boundary, continued user scrolling must hand off naturally to the surrounding page rather than trapping the user inside the nested region.
- The transition between the nested directory scroll and normal page scroll must not require a special control or an artificial page-jump.
- The desktop scroll model must preserve normal browser scrolling and must not depend on a visible page scrollbar as the only indication that the page can be scrolled.
- The exact implementation mechanism is not prescribed; the requirement is the resulting interaction behavior.

This requirement describes the validated interaction pattern as a whole: fixed header, sticky section elements where required, nested scroll container, and scroll handoff. It does not prescribe element-by-element animation or movement.

### R-013 — Scrollbar presentation

The homepage may visually hide the primary page scrollbar while preserving normal page scrolling.

If the page scrollbar is hidden, the following must remain true:

- Page scrolling remains functional with standard desktop input methods.
- Nested scroll regions remain independently usable where required.
- Hiding the scrollbar must not disable, trap, or materially obscure scrolling.
- The visual treatment must not be used as a substitute for defining the underlying scroll behavior.

This is a presentation requirement only; it does not require a particular CSS or JavaScript mechanism.

## Current Explicitly Undefined Items

These items remain requirements work rather than implementation tasks:

- Exact homepage section order.
- Exact navigation labels and destinations beyond already-established project requirements.
- Exact logo asset/version to use.
- Exact typography choices.
- Exact spacing and dimensional system.
- Exact interactive behaviors beyond their required outcomes.
- Mobile-specific layout behavior and device verification.
- Runtime data sources, if any homepage element will use live data.

These must be resolved before the relevant implementation is built, rather than guessed during coding.

## Validated Interaction Discoveries

The following discoveries are now sufficiently supported by the development work to inform the formal homepage requirements rather than remaining only implementation notes.

### D-001 — Desktop nested-scroll handoff pattern

Development of the desktop market area established a reusable interaction pattern consisting of a persistent header, sticky section elements where needed, a finite nested scroll container for the market directory, and handoff from that nested container back to normal page scrolling at its boundary.

Evidence includes the desktop scroll-handoff implementation merged in commit f92626d63d7119d5c58f39f53f9c5b79770d9412 and subsequent work preserving normal scrolling while hiding the page scrollbar in commit 4551813ab5a61e901c8c1e5163a2b8b8f9ea62b4.

The requirement records the interaction outcome, not the historical CSS implementation, so future implementations remain free to use a simpler mechanism that produces the same verified behavior.

### D-002 — Hidden scrollbar does not mean disabled scrolling

The development work established that the page scrollbar can be visually hidden while page scrolling remains active. This is therefore treated separately from the scroll model: scrollbar visibility is presentation; scrolling behavior remains functional and independently testable.


## Design Constraint

The homepage should be developed from this requirement baseline and its test definitions. Existing pre-reset website code is reference/recovery material only and must not become an implicit requirement source.
