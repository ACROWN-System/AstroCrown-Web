# Sizing and Dimensions

## Purpose

Cross-section reference index for dimensions and size-related requirements or undefined decisions. This is an extracted navigation aid, not a replacement for the originating subsystem requirements.

**Status rule:** extracted values retain their original status. A candidate/TBD/undefined item is not promoted merely by appearing here.

### R-005 — Visual system

The homepage must use the approved AstroCrown palette:

| Name | HEX | Intended semantic use |
|---|---|---|
| AstroCrown Gold | `#FFD700` | Brand identity and primary emphasis |
| AstroCrown Black | `#050914` | Deepest background |
| AstroCrown Deep Space Blue | `#081426` | Foundational deep-space environment |
| AstroCrown Space Blue | TBD | Primary dark UI surfaces, including the homepage header and navigation controls |
| AstroCrown Light Space Blue | `#16345A` | Borders, demarcation, separators |
| AstroCrown Green | `#20C878` | Positive financial state |
| AstroCrown Red | `#E5484D` | Negative financial state |
| AstroCrown Warning Yellow | `#FFD24A` | Warning, alert, caution |
| AstroCrown Warm White | `#FFF7E0` | Primary readable text |

The three blue levels form a deliberate visual hierarchy:
- AstroCrown Deep Space Blue `#081426` is the darkest blue environment layer.
- AstroCrown Space Blue is the intermediate UI-surface blue and must remain visually distinct from both adjacent blue levels.
- AstroCrown Light Space Blue `#16345A` is the lightest structural blue and is used primarily for borders, demarcation, and separators.

The AstroCrown Space Blue HEX value remains TBD until a candidate is evaluated for visual hierarchy, text/UI contrast, header use, navigation-control use, and compatibility with the established palette. It must be darker than `#16345A` and lighter than `#081426` when evaluated by the chosen color model and visual result.

Gold and Warning Yellow must remain semantically distinct.

#### R-019.1 — Dimensions and Full-Width Surface

The header shall occupy approximately 59 px in height, span the full viewport width, remain visually integrated with the homepage, and remain continuously available as required by the homepage scroll model. The exact implementation mechanism is not prescribed.

#### R-019.2 — Header Visual System

The header surface shall use a new approved AstroCrown Space Blue palette color positioned between AstroCrown Deep Space Blue and AstroCrown Light Space Blue. AstroCrown Space Blue shall be distinct from both existing colors.

The header shall:

- use an opaque, non-transparent surface;
- use AstroCrown Light Space Blue for the bottom border;
- use a transparent or partially transparent treatment for the bottom border;
- provide subtle visual delimitation between header and background without excessive contrast.

The header shall use the approved AstroCrown Space Blue as its primary opaque surface. The Space Blue value must be established before implementation and must satisfy the R-005 three-level blue hierarchy and the applicable accessibility verification requirements. It must not be selected solely by name, midpoint arithmetic, or visual preference without evaluation evidence.

#### R-019.3 — Brand Elements

### Origin: HOMEPAGE-REQUIREMENTS.md lines 1029–1057

#### R-019.11 — Continuous Adaptive Header Space

The desktop header shall use continuous horizontal space negotiation rather than abrupt sequential disappearance of navigation controls wherever the required behavior can be achieved without hard viewport-state switching.

The protected geometry shall be:

Logo | Title | Navigation | adaptive Search width | Avatar | Wallet | approximately 15–20 px right clearance

Protected invariants are:

- Logo size;
- Logo allocated surrounding space;
- Avatar size;
- Avatar allocated surrounding space;
- Wallet size;
- Wallet allocated surrounding space;
- Wallet approximately 15–20 px from the right viewport edge;
- structural position of Search relative to Avatar and Wallet.

The Search field is the adaptive-width element of the right-side group.

The navigation corridor shall adapt continuously as available width changes. Navigation controls should retain normal dimensions while progressively leaving the visible navigation region through continuous spatial displacement or occlusion rather than abrupt one-at-a-time removal wherever technically practical.

When the navigation corridor is exhausted, the AstroCrown Title may progressively slide beneath or behind the Search region as necessary. The Logo shall remain protected.

Exact breakpoints, clipping boundaries, layering order, and mechanism remain implementation decisions to be evaluated.

The preferred evaluation order is to investigate native browser layout and rendering mechanisms before introducing JavaScript viewport measurement or manual responsive state management.

#### Specification Baseline

The homepage information bar is a candidate homepage subsystem to be evaluated and refined as development evidence becomes available.

The following specification records the current UI intent and design baseline. It is not an immutable implementation specification. Dimensions, techniques, technologies, animation mechanisms, icon systems, content sources, and other details may be refined, replaced, merged, or rejected after compatibility, accessibility, redundancy, performance, and interaction testing.

#### R-020.1 — Position, Width, and Container

The information bar shall:

- be positioned below the homepage header;
- leave an empty space of approximately 45 px between the header and the information bar so that the underlying Space Art/background remains visible;
- span the available homepage content width;
- begin approximately 45 px from the left edge of the available content area;
- end approximately 22% of the available space before the right edge;
- have an initial target height of approximately 53 px;
- use rounded corners;
- provide a clearly identifiable container region distinct from the header and main content areas;
- remain structurally suitable for future automated and manual insertion, removal, or replacement of informational content without requiring a redesign of the homepage structure.

The exact geometry remains subject to responsive testing and implementation evaluation.

#### R-020.2 — Information Bar Surface and Border

The information bar shall use:

| Property | Specification |
|---|---|
| Background | AstroCrown Black `#050914`, with transparency |
| Outer border | Approximately 5 px |
| Border color | AstroCrown Warning Yellow `#FFD24A` |
| Corners | Rounded |

The transparency level is intentionally undefined and shall be evaluated against readability, background visibility, visual hierarchy, and accessibility requirements.

## R-021 — Homepage Hero Card System

### Purpose

The hero card system shall provide a compact, high-information discovery layer between the homepage information bar and market data bar. Cards shall answer high-value market questions quickly and provide direct navigation into deeper information.

Initial three-card architecture:

1. **Fear & Greed Consensus** — How does the market feel?
2. **Winners & Losers** — What is moving?
3. **Top Influences / Influence Map** — What appears to be influencing movement?

Names may be refined without changing the underlying intent.

### R-021.1 — Card Composition and Information Hierarchy

Card composition shall be determined from user task, information density, decision/action value, comprehension, retention/discovery value, interaction cost, evidence, relationship to deeper sections, and responsive constraints.

Dimensions shall not be selected solely as arbitrary viewport percentages.

Fear & Greed Consensus may receive a larger visual area where required by its gauge/speedometer and information hierarchy.

### R-021.2 — Whole-Card Interaction

Actionable cards shall behave as coherent interactive surfaces.

For navigation cards:

- the card should be the primary interaction;
- a small generic downward arrowhead may sit partly inside/partly outside the lower border;
- the arrowhead shall not create a competing destination;
- a separate large CTA shall not be introduced unless a distinct action exists;
- keyboard/assistive-technology users shall have an equivalent accessible interaction;
- hover, focus, pressed, and unavailable states shall remain distinguishable.

### R-021.3 — Fear & Greed Consensus

### Origin: HOMEPAGE-REQUIREMENTS.md lines 1793–1858

### Required structure

Current architecture:

Filter Bar → Directory ID Bar/Header → Directory Pages / Market Views → Pagination

Discovery content and the working market workspace shall remain clearly distinguishable.

### Filter taxonomy

Current candidate taxonomy:

- All;
- AI;
- Gaming;
- Meme;
- RWA;
- DePIN;
- Stable.

### Filter intelligence

Where reliable data supports it, filters may expose compact market intelligence such as AI ▲ +8%, Gaming ▼ -2%, Meme ▲ +12%, RWA ▲ +1%.

Such values require defined timeframe, universe, methodology, and source before implementation.

Filter intelligence may be reused by Influence Map, sector analysis, analytics, research, and NOVA evidence systems.

### Directory row information

Candidate/required fields include:

- pin;
- favorite;
- row number;
- token logo;
- symbol;
- name;
- price;
- selected reference-device/currency value;
- 1h/24h/7d change;
- market cap;
- 24h volume;
- circulating supply;
- price-line chart;
- buy;
- sell.

A row click shall navigate to the corresponding token/market section where such a destination exists.

### Reference device and market execution

The selected reference device/currency shall affect displayed price and percentage interpretation consistently.

The NOVA Meta-DEX & Swap concept may expose lowest buy offers, highest sell demand, DEX/swap sources, estimated gas, and paymaster estimates.

Execution-related data shall not be presented as guaranteed executable pricing unless current availability is verified.

### Directory scroll integration

The directory shall conform to R-012/R-013: nested scrolling remains usable, does not trap users, hands off naturally at boundaries, preserves page/header behavior, and works with standard desktop input methods.

### Directory explicitly undefined

Exact layout, row height, columns, sorting, pagination, filtering, search, provider architecture, real-time model, execution integration, chart implementation, and mobile layout remain undefined.
